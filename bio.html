            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <div class="bio-text">
                <br><br><p>I am thrilled to introduce myself as a dynamic and ambitious recent graduate from Randolph College, 
                    where I earned my degree in Computer Science and Mathematics in May 2024. Nestled in the charming town of Lynchburg, VA, my college journey was a blend of academic excellence and vibrant campus life.<br>

                    <br>During my time at Randolph, I wore many hats and loved every moment of it. As the President of the Dance Group, I choreographed and performed routines that brought our community together.
                    My role as Secretary for both the Black Student Alliance and the Latinx Familia Association allowed me to foster inclusivity and celebrate our diverse cultural heritage. As a Presidential Ambassador, 
                    I proudly represented Randolph College, showcasing its values and traditions to prospective students and distinguished guests.<br>
                    
                    <br>Fitness is a cornerstone of my life, and while I might not be an athlete, I am incredibly disciplined and motivated. I'm currently training for a half marathon, a personal challenge to test my limits and prove my strength.
                    Each run is a step towards not just physical endurance but mental fortitude as well.<br>
                    
                    <br>One of the most exhilarating experiences of my life was my internship with NASA. Working with the Natural Disasters team at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, 
                    I was able to contribute to groundbreaking projects that have real-world impacts. This opportunity not only enhanced my technical skills but also fueled my passion for using technology to solve complex problems.<br>
                    
                    <br>I follow a pescatarian diet, which keeps me energized and focused. Originally hailing from the beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado, I am deeply family-oriented and cherish the bonds I have with my loved ones.
                    My roots keep me grounded while my aspirations push me to reach for the stars.<br>
                    
                    <br>In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me indulging in my "nerdy" passions. Whether it's geeking out over the latest tech innovations, diving deep into mathematical puzzles, 
                    or losing myself in a captivating sci-fi universe, I revel in the joy of continuous learning and discovery.<br>
                    
                    <br>From my multifaceted roles on campus and my NASA adventure to my current marathon training and nerdy hobbies, my journey is driven by a relentless pursuit of growth and excellence. 
                    I am excited about the future and eager to see where my passions will take me next!</p>
